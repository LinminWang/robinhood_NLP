Backgroud:

Robinhood is one of the most popular and trustworthy apps for stock-trading market, and it remained so until Jan. 28th 2021, when it decided to deploy controversial measures to stop the trade of GameStop stocks, leading to a large number of negative reviews and ratings left by furious stock traders. Reviews written after that day will inevitably misrepresent the true values of Robinhood app itself, and building a smarter rating/review system to recognize biased and untruthful reviews will undoubtedly provider a more accurate description of the app. As such, this project aims to: 1) classify a review made after Jan. 28th 2021 as biased due to external factors, in an attempt to extract useful feedback related to the app itself; 2) perform sentiment analysis on the biased reviews produced in step 1), to uncover the cause without the benefit of hindsight. 

The analysis will be performed on datasets scraped from IOS app store within the U.S. branch using customized scripts. The dataset will be divided into two subsets consisting of reviews made before and after the 28th, namely the ‘old’ set and the ‘new’ set, respectively. The ‘old’ set will first be preprocessed by the three language models, i.e. BoW, tf-idf and word2vec, and then to be later used for training various supervised classification models of choice. The best-performing model will be used to determine whether a review from the ‘new’ set is indeed biased given the similarities/differences from the ‘old’ set, thereby isolating the ‘true’ reviews from many biased ones. The biased reviews will then be processed in sentiment analysis to uncover user emotions and underlying cause, as if no information were given outside of the collected dataset.
